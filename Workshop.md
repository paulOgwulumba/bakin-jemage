# Workshop: Le Chat Noir

---

In this workshop, we'll go through our bounty hack submission for the Decentralized Umoja 3 Bounty Hack.

This workshop assumes that you've completed the tutorial.

I'll assume that youâ€™ll go through this workshop in a directory named `~/reach/le-chat-noir`:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/reach/le-chat-noir
```

And that you have a copy of Reach installed in ~/reach so you can write

```bash
$ ../reach version
```

and it will run Reach.

You should start off by initializing your Reach program:

```bash
$ ../reach init
```
